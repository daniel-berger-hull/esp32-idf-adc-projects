  Included a better HTML page for the control, with better styling and javascript inside
  Improved the compress.py script
  The HTML page is polling now the ESP32 server, and fetch a random value (fake milliVolt)

 To Do:
   Improve the CSS of the HTML  (The header of the control-box)
   Study carefully all the method of the main.c (some are GET some are POST)
   Include the ADC reading code
   Push the value red to the web page (instead of the current random value)
   Add an indicator on the Web Page to show if the ESP32 appears up or down (like a red/green led on the screen)



 Next:
   Another milestrong will be to send chunk of values, instead of only one ADC values (10? 100? more?)
   Have a graph on the web page to see the values over time
   Consider Web Socket later?

=====

Wrote a Python script to take an HTML document and translate it into a C-string that can be added into main.c
and served as web page by the server.

Display Analog read on page
   create a timer on the web page that send HTTP query and fetch values values

=====

 Modified the simpleHTTPServer to blink the green led, using a seperated Thread
 Added the registration to serve an index.html file (http://10.0.0.250/index.html)
 Used the HTML string of the '\WiFiServer\webserver_with_led' to serve an HTML

 To Do:
   To serve an HTML document, the HTML as to be concerted to be a C string. Find an tool that does that
   Add buttons and control on the index.html page
   ESP32 to start to react to commands from the index.html

=====

Tested a simple thread that blinks led (esp32-idf\Blink\blink project)

Tested (and worked) the http_server from the example.
Copied project here (Working):  
   C:\data\Electronic\workspace\esp32-idf\WiFiServer\simpleHTTPServer
   
  NOTE: The ssid and password need to be modified in the common 
         \examples\common_components\protocol_examples_common\include


To Do:
   * Continue to study the example
   * Add more GET methods that the server can reply to
   * Add an internal thread, like flashing a LED
   * Should try to extract the common code int the protocol_examples_common and merge   into main.c

=========

 Started the idf on the DanServerPC. Been able to build and flash few examples,
 like the Blink, the Wifi SoftAP and Wifi Station.

To Do:
 Need to try ADC project
 Then try an ADC with DMA (continus conversion may be a candiate?)
